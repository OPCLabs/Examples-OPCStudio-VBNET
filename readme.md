This directory contains examples for OPC client, server and subscriber development in VB.NET. The examples cover OPC Data 
Access (OPC DA), OPC Alarms&Events (OPC A&E), OPC XML, and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) specifications, including OPC 
UA PubSub. They are supported on Microsoft Windows and Linux.

The client and subscriber examples work with our sample servers and publishers. Most of them reside on the Web; OPC 
"Classic" servers for Windows are installed using the [OPC Studio Setup program](https://www.opclabs.com/download).
