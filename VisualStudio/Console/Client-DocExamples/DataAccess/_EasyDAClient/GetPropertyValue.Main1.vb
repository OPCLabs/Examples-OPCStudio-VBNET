#Region "Example"
' This example shows how to get a value of a single OPC property.
'
' Note that some properties may not have a useful value initially (e.g. until the item is activated in a group), which also the
' case with Timestamp property as implemented by the demo server. This behavior is server-dependent, and normal. You can run 
' IEasyDAClient.ReadItemValue.Main.vbs shortly before this example, in order to obtain better property values. Your code may 
' also subscribe to the item in order to assure that it remains active.
